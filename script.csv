"Rochelle is a bad driver who can't seem to pass her driving test."
"Margret is the consoling type, who always tries their best to find the positives in a situation."
"Chloe is a brutally honest person who tells it as it is."

"MARGRET"
"So, Rochelle, I hear you did your driving test yesterday, how did it go??"
"ROCHELLE"
"Well, let's just say we won't be going on any road trips anytime soon ..."
"CHLOE"
"Oh no, how could you have possibly failed? If I can pass the first time anyone can."
"MARGRET"
"Chloe stop that! You're making driving tests sound easy as if they aren't the most nerve-wracking test you can do."
"ROCHELLE"
"Thank you, Margret, I was bricking it, to be honest. I didn't know what to expect at all."
"CHLOE"
"Didn't you have a practice run right before the test? How did you do in that one?"
"ROCHELLE"
"If I had done my test like the practice one I would've passed with flying colours. I honestly don't understand what happened."
"MARGRET"
"It took me three tests before I passed, so honestly don't worry."
"CHLOE"
"Anyways, tell us what happened word for word. I'm so curious now."
"ROCHELLE"
"Well, initially It started great, but as time went on it slowly went downhill."
"MARGRET"
"Downhill in what way???"
"ROCHELLE"
"It was going swimmingly at first, I was successfully using my mirrors and navigating roundabouts, to be quite honest I was surprised at myself for how well I was doing."
"CHLOE"
"So then what happened? When did it all start going wrong?"
"ROCHELLE"
"It started going downhill as I was driving past the primary school..."
"MARGRET"
"What happened at the primary school..."

"ACT II"
"ROCHELLE"
"As I was driving past the primary school, it had just hit 2 pm. So as I was driving past an unsupervised child ran out onto the road..."
"CHLOE"
"YOU HIT A CHILD?"
"ROCHELLE"
"Of course not, I braked as quick as I could before their mother yanked them out of the way before anything could happen."
"MARGRET"
"Oh my god, that's the worst possible thing to happen to someone during a driving test."
"ROCHELLE"
"I was almost in tears, I thought it couldn't get any worse."
"CHLOE"
"Surely nothing worse could've happened after that?"
"ROCHELLE"
"Oh but it did."
"MARGRET"
"There's quite possibly nothing else that could go as wrong as that did."
"ROCHELLE"
"When I was driving down the road, I turned too early into a housing estate that I had never seen or been to before."
"CHLOE"
"That isn't a bad thing per se, that could work to your advantage."
"ROCHELLE"
"It possibly could yes, but as I drove down to the end of the estate I noticed a one way only sign for the opposite direction I was driving in."
"CHLOE"
"Yikes."
"MARGRET"
"Okay, there's no coming back from that one."
"ROCHELLE"
"For real, I should've just gotten out of the car at that point and walked home because I couldn't possibly do any worse. But somehow even I managed to surprise myself by making yet another stupid mistake."
"CHLOE"
"How could you possibly do even worse than driving down a one-way street?"

"ACT III"
"MARGRET"
"There is physically no other possible way in which you could mess up worse than those other two things combined."
"ROCHELLE"
"I ran a red light."
"CHLOE"
"Are you stupid, blind, or both?"
"MARGRET"
"I can't even defend you for this one, how did you even manage to do that."
"ROCHELLE"
"As I was approaching the light it turned yellow and honestly, I thought I would make it in time, so I sped up and it turned red and I just didn't stop."
"CHLOE"
"You're an idiot. Who doesn't stop at a yellow light, especially during their test? You were begging to fail."
"MARGRET"
"You're a danger on the roads, maybe it's a good thing you didn't get your license after all."
"ROCHELLE"
"Wow guys, way to kick me when I'm down."
"MARGRET"
"When can you reapply for a test?"
"ROCHELLE"
"Well, because I failed I have to wait 6 weeks before I can reapply again. Hopefully, next time will be different."
"CHLOE"
"I think they should ban you from reapplying after that performance."
"MARGRET"
"Chloe don't be so mean, I'm sure she'll pass next time."
"ROCHELLE"
"If I don't pass next time, I'm just going to walk everywhere for the rest of my life. I can't take failing more than once."
"MARGRET"
"What's that supposed to mean?"

"ACT III"
"Rochelle"
"I ran a red light."
"Chloe"
"Are you stupid, blind, or both?"
"Margret"
"Is this a joke?"
"Rochelle"
"As I was approaching the traffic lights, the light turned yellow and I thought that I would make it in time, so I sped up and as I just got to the line it turned red. I don't know why I didn't stop."
"Chloe"
"You're an idiot. You deserved to fail after doing that."
"Margret"
"Maybe it's a good thing you didn't get your license this time around, I think you need a lot more practice."
"Rochelle"
"Well, you'll never guess what, I lied. I passed my test."
"*Rochelle pulls the pass certificate out of her bag*"
"Chloe"
"How could you have possibly passed after making so many mistakes, life-threatening mistakes at that?"
"Rochelle"
"I have no clue. While we were driving down the estate, my tester was too focused on finding somewhere to pull in to do a 3 point turn so I don't think they saw the one-way sign. When I ran the red light, they began writing a note down on their iPad as it turned red so I think they genuinely didn't see it and assumed I had just made it on the yellow."
"Margret"
"Wow. I have no words."
"Chloe"
"That tester needs to be fired because you are an absolute danger on the roads. Are you sure you didn't bride them or anything?"
"Rochelle"
"Of course, I didn't bride them, that's highly illegal."
"Chloe"
"And so is running a red light but you still did that anyways."
"Rochelle"
"Why can't you just be happy that I passed the first time? Anyways, who wants to go on a road trip this week?"
"Chloe"
"I am never getting in a car with you, do I look like I have a death wish?"
"Margret"
"Me neither, I want to come home in one piece."
"They all laugh"

"ACT III"
"Margret"
"There is physically no other possible way in which you could mess up worse than those other two things combined."
"Rochelle"
"Oh but I still managed to do it somehow."
"Chloe"
"What did you do?"
"Rochelle"
"So I did pass my test, somehow."
"Margret"
"What? But you just told us you failed?"
"Chloe"
"And that you nearly hit a child and drove down a one way street?"
"Rochelle"
"I know, but nearly hitting a child doesn't count as a fail in itself, and I don't think the tester noticed the one way sign as we turned before we reached it."
"Chloe"
"Then why did you tell us you failed if you didn't?"
"Rochelle"
"After I passed and received my pass certificate, I went to book an appointment online to go and get my physical license. But, as I was reading over my theory license I noticed that the date on my license was different to what I originally thought it was."
"Chloe"
"Okay what does that have to do with you suddenly failing."
"Rochelle"
"It meant that my license was actually under 6 months old, meaning that I shouldn't of been able to sit the test itself. But the website never stopped me from booking it and the tester never stopped me from sitting it."
"Margret"
"That's so strange, but couldn't you have just waited to get your physical license for a small bit so that the license would be a good bit over the 6 months old?"
"Rochelle"
"That was my original plan until an NDLS letter with big red writing came through the door a week later."
"Margret"
"Oh my god, what did it say?"
"Rochelle"
"They null and voided my test and I have to do it all over again."
"Chloe"
"Oh my gosh , I don't know how you're not in tears telling this story. I wouldn't be okay after something like that happening to me!"
"They all laugh"
